# LogGuardian
LogGuardian is a real-time AI-driven log anomaly detection system designed for Kubernetes environments.
It streams pod logs directly from the Kubernetes API, processes both JSON and plain-text logs (including multi-line stack traces), detects abnormal behavior using statistical analysis, and generates AI-powered incident summaries with root cause hypotheses and mitigation guidance.

Unlike traditional log monitoring tools, KubeSentinel combines deterministic anomaly detection with AI-based reasoning to provide contextualized, human-readable incident reports.
